# Premium Quick Launcher 1B (An alternative to PQ1)

Wordpress Theme built for scalability

## Getting Started - Setup a Local Wordpress Site

To get started, start by forking this repo and setting up a Wordpress install locally. This repo includes:

- `local.sql.gz` - starter database (import db into your local settings, changing the `siteurl` and `home` url under `wp_options` to reflect your local environment)
- `wp_content` - includes all assets you will need (plugins, theme, etc)

## Theme Documentation

To begin working on the theme go to the [theme folder](wp-content/themes/pq1b/readme.md)
